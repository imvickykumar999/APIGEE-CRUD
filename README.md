------------------------------------

### Host :
  A host is any hardware device that has the capability of permitting access to a network via a user interface, specialized software, network address, protocol stack, or any other means. Some examples include, but are not limited to, computers, personal electronic devices, thin clients, and multi-functional devices.
  
------------------------------------

### Base Path :
  BasePath is the URL prefix for all API paths, relative to the host root. It must start with a leading slash / . If basePath is not specified, it defaults to / , that is, all paths start at the host root.
  
------------------------------------

### End Point :
  Endpoints are the locations of the resources, and the API uses endpoint URLs to retrieve the requested resources. An API endpoint is a point at which an API -- the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other -- connects with the software program. APIs work by sending requests for information from a web application or web server and receiving a response.
  
------------------------------------

### Version :
  APIs only need to be up-versioned when a breaking change is made.
  Breaking changes include:

  - a change in the <ins>format</ins> of the response data for one or more calls
  - a change in the *request or response* type (i.e. changing an integer to a float)
  - removing any part of the API.
  
------------------------------------

### Query :
  API Query is a generic query component to read data from JSON and XML based APIs.
  
------------------------------------

### Header :
  API headers are like an extra source of information for each API call you make. Their job is to represent the <ins>*meta-data*</ins> associated with an API request and response. If you ever encounter issues with an API, the first place you should look is the headers, since they can help you track down any potential issues.
